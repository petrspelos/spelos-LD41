## About this submission

This submission is quite unusual for me since this will be the first time I work alone. And as if that wasn't enough, I'll only have a day to complete it. That is why I chose HTML/CSS/JavaScript, since, for me, it provides the most flexibility given the time constraints.

## Why does this repo contain code before the event started?

The event has many different "[flavors](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/rules)" and I am going with the Jam variant. That means I have an extra day after the weekend to put my submission together. I most likely won't use the extra time, since I'm free only during the weekend, but the opportunity is there. I also may use any pre-existant code that I might have. And that is why I prepared a basic outline pretty much setting up the project, getting jQuery, Bootstrap and perhaps even some utility functions I might write.
